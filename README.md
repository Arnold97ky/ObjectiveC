#ObjectiveC
Funny story about the title. I did Work with at least 3 API, it was on the third one I got one working as i wanted. My second one was a Fish API, and then when i got it "Digimon API", I just add the model in the project Fish API and still working with that. Then Now i have my project name Fish but the project is about Digimon(Pokemon).
I decide to just leave the name like that, look funny. The project is just about how to work with Objective-C and doing some Unit Test too.

Project Digimon:
Language: Obj-C 
It was hard depending of the Api selected to work. My first api was runnig succefully but i was getting nothing on my view.  My second API was not working at all. Then after some reseache with a basic Api, the project was working succefully.

Architecture: MVVM
Better Understanding of the project. Not serious problem to implement each file.

ViewModel: In Swift.
In beginning my file was not comming with a Header. Was oblige to create a new project and finally it was coming.

Unit Test for ViewModel:
basic funtion as giving a String was easy to implement and get test and success.


Feature:
Work on the Unit Test and test the func image
Add a Detail View Controller
Beautify the view.
